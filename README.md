## Idea
I was looking for a convenient way to maintain home budget for some time and soon realized that a good portion of my expenses (ones shared with my friends) is already tracked in Splitwise. I wanted to avoid duplicating these expenses into a "proper" budget app and decided to use Splitwise for personal expenses as well. While being a great expenses sharing app, Splitwise has its limitations when it comes to analyzing your spending. **That's where Splitsheet comes in!**

## How to get started

#### Config
Open a [template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ochf-oudqJyY8cuDH2GMY9JhGq7nkl0JgkQwcaEugDc/edit#gid=1538565547) and **make a copy**. Once you have your own Splitsheet, open *Config* sheet and fill in previously obtained Splitwise **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**. Also, choose a **default currency** by providing its code (USD, EUR, PLN etc).

#### Splitwise API key
1. You need **Splitwise API key** to use the script. Go to your [Splitwise app dashboard](https://secure.splitwise.com/apps)
2. Click *Register your application* and fill out the required fields:
    - **Application name**: Splitsheet
    - **Application description**: Splitsheet is an expense tracker Google Docs spreadsheet with a script that pulls data from Splitwise
    - **Homepage URL**: https://github.com/bartoszkaminski/splitsheet
3. Additionally we need to fill out a callback URL as well to support OAuth2.0 from apps script. To do this follow these steps:
    - Navigate to https://script.google.com/
    - Click the `edit` icon next to the script(project) named `Splitwise` which is the app script project linked to the spreadsheet that we created in `Config` setup
    - Click `File -> Project Properties`
    - Copy `Script ID`
    - Replace `SCRIPT ID` in the sample url `https://script.google.com/macros/d/{SCRIPT ID}/usercallback` to form the final callback url
    - Add this url in the `Callback URL` field on your splitwise application registration screen and save all changes

Other optional fields can be left blank.  
Click *Register and get API key* to obtain your **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** required in the next step.

#### Authorize Splitsheet
Open a month sheet, choose *Splitwise* -> *Update* from the menu. Follow link from the dialog to **authorize** Splitsheet in Splitwise. One you get *"Success! You can close this tab"* response, you are all set! Use *Splitwise* -> *Update* once again and your expenses should be visible.

## Usage
There are some things you need to know before using this fork of Splitsheet.

#### Personal expenses
The most convenient way to track personal expenses in Splitwise is to create a group with you as the only member. Any expense you create there will be assigned to you.

#### Excluding certain transaction categories
Splitwise marks *Settle all balances* as the description for transactions that are automatically added to simplify and consolidate a customer's debt across multiple groups and/or friend. As these are not real transactions and end up creating entries (unwanted) on spreadsheet I excluded the transactions from `debt_consolidation` category.

Additionally, deleted and `payment` transactions (settlements) are also excluded to avoid double counting expenses.

#### Currency
Splitsheet supports multiple currencies but all expenses are presented in user's currency which must be specified in *Config* sheet. Conversion rate from the date of the transacion is used.

#### Date range
You can choose a date range for each month in the upper right corner of the sheet. Provide a closed range, expenses from both endpoints dates' will be included.

#### Trips expenses
I decided that *Dining out*, *Car* or *Groceries* while on a trip is something different than at home. That's why the script changes category of all expenses that belong to groups of type *Trip* to a new category *Entertainment/Trips*
